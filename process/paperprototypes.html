                <p> In this prototype I realizded that thaking out the component of the introduction at the beginnign of starting the game leads to confusion. I took it off in the first place because it could make people impatient, because I genereally get impatient if I play the first level or open the app and it replays over and over. I feel that since it is going to be i the context of a museum it will be easier to bear with. People are not necessarily going to play it on their mobile apps out of boredom, it will be out of curiousity. I also think that since I didn't really put the story in the paper prototype, they got a bit confused about the objective. With the pop out instructions that you see, the person read them and got the objective. They did, however, try to move the actual instructions rather than closing them and playing. Making the distinction between the game and the instructions is important. I think for being a WIP in general The info and levels pages can be changed or not incorporated at this point. It can be something extra. I am still contemplating using "stars" in that instead of points being the main aspect, it could be that you did or did not complete the task.</p>

                <p> Overall, I wish I had more time to actually draw out the pages; I was missing a few. But I think it was also good to have it be quick so I could see what I personally thought it was beneficial. It was interesting to see that the person who I was paired up with did not bother to look at instructions, they went right into pressing play on the game. I also noticed I forgot to place some of the screens like the score pages. I also forgot to add a new game button. When I played the “videos” they skipped them and also did not use any tool tips. The person who I was paired up with was also working on a game, so they might already be well versed in these types of games. Or maybe it does not need to be too overly complicated and letting the person figure some stuff out for themselves is not a bad aspect.</p>
