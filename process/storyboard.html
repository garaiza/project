                <p>  At the very beginning of the storyboarding process, I did not really know what type of people I wanted to look at my game. I thought about it for a while beforehand and it used to just be an application that anyone could download off the appstore and play it from there. But since it is for Isea then the people who are going to be analyzing it would be artistically knowledgeable or at least want to be educated in some way. Since I have been to many museums, particularly science museums, I felt that this game would fit best in that location.</p>

                <p> Through this process of creating the storyboard I was able to see who I wanted to target the game to. People who go to museums are usually already going to go get insight on topics, they are actively searching. People who just download games are usually trying to pass the time and don't necessarily think back on the message or story. It could be interesting to let people who go to the museum get to play the game, or that it could be part of the museum website. That way I can focus the game to certain types of people, that can then further spread the information. And by putting it in a museum setting it also, in a way, invades the personal space of "true" art.</p>
